# Global Learning Landscape
An open source taxonomy for the future of education. Mapping the learning and talent innovation landscape.

## About the Global Learning Landscape
The 2019 Global Learning Landscape is an open source taxonomy for mapping innovation in learning and talent. Combining machine learning with a global community of experts, we analyzed over 50,000 organizations, 500,000 education apps and considered the 3 million schools, colleges and universities around the world. Using the classical top-down / bottom-up design methodology, the 2019 Global Learning Landscape was built around 50 core clusters along a learning journey. From knowledge and curriculum through engagement and assessment to workforce and talent, the Global Learning Landscape is inspired by design thinking, following the learner from early childhood to lifelong learning.

Licensed under Creative Commons and as an open source project, the taxonomy is available for anyone to support their own work in education innovation, to identify an area of focus, or to locate their organization and their peers on the landscape.

A global community of educators and innovators can track and contribute to the taxonomy’s ongoing development. Following an agile approach, suggestions, ideas and iterations on enhancements will be open and available on GitHub, which provides a robust 21st Century way of sharing and curating the taxonomy, where anyone can contribute, share ideas or transparently trace each step of the landscape's evolution. 

## Methodology
The Global Learning Landscape embraces two classical approaches to analysis and design. Top Down / Bottom Up and Human Intuition / Machine Intelligence.

### Bottom Up - Machine Learning
In order to support the development of the taxonomy, we initially undertook ‘bottom-up’ analysis using machine learning and natural language technology by analysing 50K education organizations and edtech startups, 500K education apps, and millions of schools, colleges and universities worldwide to identify overall patterns in the data. This machine intelligence approach uses 'Unsupervised Learning' to find hidden patterns or grouping in data that are not biased by the more traditional taxonomies of education.

### Top Down - Human Expertise
Drawing on the work of a global community of education innovators, researchers and practitioners, human expertise was then deployed to interpret patterns that the machine intelligence process produced. Consideration of context, history, purpose, business model, technologies and ecosystem relationships added depth and interpretive understanding to the process and enabled validation of findings against the models and innovations found in education today or expected in the future.

## Who we are
HolonIQ is a globally unique education market intelligence firm. Our mission is to connect the world with the technology, skills and capital to transform education through access to the most comprehensive education innovation dataset, intelligence tools and global network of people and ideas.

We help companies, institutions, governments and investors power growth and innovation by connecting billions of data points about education startups, technologies, deal flow, schools, universities, jobs, skills, research and patents and apply machine learning to analyze, evaluate and identify patterns, generating insights that help clients make data-driven decisions and answer strategic questions.

With billions of data-points connected in just a few short months, we have already helped governments, institutions, companies and entrepreneurs in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia answer strategic questions about market trends, growth strategies, investment focus, business performance and benchmarking.

## Why we did this
Education is a complex sector, combining important social, economic, cultural, intellectual and personal factors and operating at global, national, local and personal levels. However, information and data about education and the innovation that is occuring throughout the system is fragmented and anchored in its local environment, making cooperation across contexts difficult, thus hindering material innovation in the sector.

We have been building, investing and mapping innovation in education for decades and have had the opportunity to work with entrepreneurs, educators, institutions and governments globally. One of the constant themes arising from our engagements and conversations with each of these stakeholders is the difficulty in accessing, understanding and learning from innovations undertaken elsewhere.

The Global Learning Landscape provides common structure and language for identifying, tracking and making sense of the complexity and volume of innovation happening in education all around the world by providing a well-defined, robust, accessible and community enabled taxonomy.

Using a common framework will support the discovery of, and access to innovation initiatives, provide opportunities for collaboration and benchmarking, reduce barriers to innovation and allow analysis and trend mapping within or across innovation clusters. Licenced under Creative Commons and as an open source project, the taxonomy is available for anyone to support their own work in education innovation. The global community can track and contribute to the taxonomy’s ongoing development via GitHub.

## Knowledge Discovery
Advancements in artificial intelligence technology is driving an increasingly sophisticated approach to unlocking knowledge from enormous volumes of text-based data to uncover new patterns, connections and ideas. Powerful search capability and automated, intelligent systems can connect knowledge from multiple language formats.

Knowledge is increasing found in video, audio and other new digital formats. Deep tech start-ups are mining this data, connecting it with other points such as geo- and bio- information to identify new knowledge.
